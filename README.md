# hello-world

Hi Folks!  Tim here, I've been in the software development process for well nigh on to 30 years now.
Started in dBase III, moved into C and Gupta SQLWindows and Basic with an aside in network administration
and some release management, then on to configuration engines like Selectica and SAP LO-VC.  Now I'm doing
.NET (C#) at work and Swift at home to keep my fingers in different pies.
